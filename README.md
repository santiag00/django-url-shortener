url-shortener
==================

This code shows how to run an API in Django to create short URLs.
It comes with a docker-compose file to run everything in a single Docker container.

To run this container, you need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) first.
Then clone this repository and run the container using Docker Compose::
```
  $ git clone git://github.com/santiag00/url-shortener.git
  $ cd url-shortener
  $ docker-compose up -d
```
###Â Features
#### Getting all URLs that were shortened
`curl -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/"`

#### Creating a new short URL
You can optionally pass a `devices` object specifying target URLs for tablets and mobile devices.

`curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
	"data": {
		"url": "http://example.com",
		"devices": {
			"mobile": "http://m.example.com",
			"tablet": "http://t.example.com"
		}
	}
}' "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/"`

#### Redirecting to the appropriate target URL
Replace `<some-url>` with an actual short URL generated by the API.

`curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:8000/<some-url>"`
